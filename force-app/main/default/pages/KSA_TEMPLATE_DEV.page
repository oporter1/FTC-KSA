In consideration of myself or my minor child or ward being permitted to participate in the Events/Activities referenced above, you hereby attest that, after reading this Sports Waiver and Permission Form completely and carefully, including the notice above your signature, as required by Florida Statutes 744.301, you acknowledge that participation in the Event/Activity by myself or my child or ward is entirely voluntary, and that you understand and agree as follows:<br/><br/><strong>RELEASE OF LIABILITY:</strong> I agree, on behalf of myself or my child or ward, to waive and release all liabilities, claims, actions, damages, costs or expenses of any nature (“Claims”) associated with all risks that are inherent to my or his or her participation in the event and/or the activities specified above or other activities conducted in conjunction therewith (the “Event/Activity”) (which risks may include, among other things, exposure to Naegliria Fowlerii and coliform bacteria, muscle injuries, heat and stress related issues, cuts, lacerations and broken bones), whether such risks are open and obvious or otherwise. Further on behalf of myself, I hereby release, covenant not to sue, and forever discharge the Released Parties (as defined under "INDEMNITY/INSURANCE" below) of and from all Claims arising in any manner out of or in any way connected with myself or my child's or ward's participation in the Event/Activity. <br/><br/>
<strong>INDEMNITY/INSURANCE:</strong> I agree to indemnify and hold each of KSA Events, Inc., subsidiary and other affiliated or related companies (the “Kaylee Enterprises”); the Event host, all Event sponsors and charities having a presence at the Event/Activity, the sponsors of KSA Events, Event contractors, subsidiary and other affiliated or related companies; and the officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors, sub-contractors, representatives, successors, assigns, and volunteers of each of the foregoing entities (collectively, the “Released Parties”) harmless from and against any and all Claims arising out of or in any way connected with myself or my child's or ward's participation in the Event/Activity, wherever the Event/Activity may occur, including, but not limited to, all attorneys' fees and disbursements through and including any appeal.

I agree that I am not relying on the Released Parties to have arranged for, or carry, any insurance of any kind for my benefit or that of myself or my child or ward relative to myself or my child's or ward's participation in the activities and the Event, and that I am solely responsible for obtaining any mandatory or desired life, travel, accident, property, or other insurance related to myself or my child's or ward's participation in the Event/Activity, at my own expense.

Additionally, I authorize medical treatment for myself or my child or ward, at my cost, if the need arises; however, I acknowledge that the Released Parties will have no duty, obligation or liability arising out of the provision of, or failure to provide, medical treatment. 
<br/><br/>

<strong>EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES INSPECTION:</strong> I, or my child or ward if I am not in attendance at the Event/Activity, will immediately advise the Event manager of any unsafe condition that I, or my child or ward if I am not in attendance at the Event/Activity, observe.

You acknowledge and agree that you assume these inherent risks associated with attendance. 
<br/><br/>

<strong>PUBLICITY RIGHTS:</strong> I further grant the Released Parties the right to photograph, record and/or videotape me and my child or ward and further to display, edit, use and/or otherwise exploit my or myself or my child's or ward's name, face, likeness, Event/Activity results (as more fully described below), voice, and appearance in all media, whether now known or hereafter devised, (including, without limitation, in computer or other device applications, online webcasts, television programming in motion pictures, films, newspapers, and magazines) and in all forms including, without limitation, digitized images or video, throughout the universe in perpetuity, whether for advertising, publicity, or promotional purposes, including, without limitation, publication and use of Event/Activity results and standings (including but not limited to name, bib number, if applicable, age, times, if applicable, gender, “hometown”, or other standard Event/Activity results), without compensation, residual obligations, reservation or limitation, or further approval, and I agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Released Parties for any Claims associated with such grant and right to use.
